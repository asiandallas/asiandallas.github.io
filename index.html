                    <h2>About Me...</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a 4th year CIS major at CSUSM! Being a CIS major, I have broad knowledge
                        in both Computer Science and Business. When I was a high school senior, I grew an interest in 
                        programming and how we are able to write code that solves problems. Throughout my degree, I've learned to enjoy problem 
                        solving and being able to transform an idea into a final product. I hope to use my 
                        technical skills in a business setting and be involved in products that help and make an impact on people.
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                        After graduating college in May 2024, I will be joining Wells Fargo as a Technology Analyst (Software Engineering)
                        in their San Fransisco office!
                        I also hope to gain more knowledge in cloud computing and possibly learn more about cybersecurity.
                    </p>
                        <br>

                    </p>
                        Outside of school, I enjoy a variety of hobbies including speedcubing, photography, travelling, listening to music (KPOP!!),
                        and exploring new food.
                        
                        Speedcubing has been a big part of my life, as I have been competing since 2017. I enjoy
                        solving puzzles such as the megaminx and have solved a 3x3 in 9 seconds.

                        I also love seeing new places and it is a big goal of mine to visit all 50 states, where I'm currently at 35/50!
                        Going to these places, I enjoy trying out new food, and capturing beautiful landscape & night shots.
